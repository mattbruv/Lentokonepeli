# Lentokonepeli

> Fly your planes to victory as you re-create the aerial battles of the First World War!

This is a modern remake of the competitive 2D multiplayer airplane game [Lentokonepeli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCCCUXUwlT8)
(_Literal translation from Finnish: "airplane game", also known in English as Dogfight_).

## NOTE

⚠️ **CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT** ⚠️

I am remaking this codebase for the fourth(!) time, starting March of 2024.

Lots of planned features are in mind, including a website with accounts, leaderboards, and statistics tracking.

and interact with the community.

## History

The game was originally created in 2005 by the Finnish game studio [Playforia (Aapeli)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playforia).
Their gaming website was built in 2002 entirely on Java.
As web browsers would begin to treat Java as a security risk,
their website became less and less accessible
until it was permanently shut down in 2019.

With the death of Playforia, Dogfight should have died too.
Fortunately, I was able to download a copy of the [client-side jar](https://github.com/mattbruv/playray-dogfight-client) file before the site went offline.
This jar file contained game assets such as images and audio.
It is now possible to recreate the game using these assets, along with reverse engineering the physics through captured video and other documentation.

The purpose of this project is to bring this nostalgic game back to life and keep it alive forever.

## Development

Currently in progress.
This section will be re-written when there is something to show.
